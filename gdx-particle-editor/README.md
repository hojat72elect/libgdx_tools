## Purpose

The GDX Particle Editor is now the official particle editor for libGDX. These are the goals of the project:

* Target all desktop platforms including M1 Macs.
* Disallow any use of Swing, AWT, or similar toolkits. GDX Particle Editor is solely a Scene2D.UI project.
* Improve the workflow and interface for maximum efficiency and attractiveness.
* Export libGDX compatible particle effects. Extra features requiring a separate runtime library will not be supported.
* Include all features available in the original [Particle Editor](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/tree/master/extensions/gdx-tools/src/com/badlogic/gdx/tools/particleeditor).
